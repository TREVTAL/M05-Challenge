 M05 Challenge

## Description
M05 Challenge, Work Day Scheduler has the following features:
* When the planner is opened, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
* When you scroll down, time blocks are presented for my business hours
* Time blocks are color coded so past hours are grayed out, current hour is in red and future hours are in green
* When a time block is clicked, you can edit the content (write text)
* When you click the save button, the added text in that hour is saved
* Saved events are stored in local storage. Upon page reload, stored values persist until local storage is erased.
